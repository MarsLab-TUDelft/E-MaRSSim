Open-source educational MRI pulse sequence simulation tool

This notebook contains a simple MRI simulator which can be used to define a custom pulse sequence and simulate an image acquisition on a phantom. During this tutorial we will simulate a spoiled GRE sequence on a cardiac phantom and we will observe the effects of blood flow.
